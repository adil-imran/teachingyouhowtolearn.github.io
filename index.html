<h2 id="welcome-to-teaching-you-how-to-learn-">Welcome to Teaching You How To Learn!</h2>
<p>The aim of this site is to act as a natural extension of the <a href="https://80000hours.org/">80,000 Hours</a> website. </p>
<p>80,000 Hours is a fantastic site for assessing how to choose an impactful career (aligning with <a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/">Effective Altruism</a> values). I want to create a similarly essential site that <strong>outlines how to best develop knowledge</strong>, and also to act as a repository of Effective Altruism flashcards to improve knowledge sharing &amp; retention.</p>
<p>The current aim is to outline the best techniques for learning and gaining knowledge in a short series of blog posts, and to share free flashcard decks related to Effective Altruism for people to use to test meta-learning out for themselves. </p>
<p>I believe that empowering people to gain as much knowledge as possible in their chosen fields will help them increase their impact over their careers.</p>
